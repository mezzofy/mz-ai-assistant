```

Each agent is selected by the Router based on the user's department and message intent. Agents load skills on demand, orchestrate multi-tool workflows, and return structured results.

---

## Base Agent (`base_agent.py`)

```python
class BaseAgent:
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.config = config
        self.llm = None       # Set by LLM Manager
        self.skills = {}
        self.tools = {}

    def can_handle(self, task: dict) -> bool:
        """Does this agent handle the task?"""
        raise NotImplementedError

    async def execute(self, task: dict) -> dict:
        """Run the multi-step workflow. Return result dict."""
        raise NotImplementedError

    def _load_skill(self, skill_name):
        """Load a skill and register its tools."""
        ...

    def _require_permission(self, task, permission):
        """Check user has required permission. Raise if not."""
        if permission not in task["permissions"]:
            raise PermissionError(f"Requires '{permission}' permission")
```

### Task Sources

Agents can be invoked from three sources. The `task` dict includes a `source` field:

| Source | Trigger | Auth | Delivery |
|--------|---------|------|----------|
| `mobile` | User sends message via app | JWT + RBAC | Response to app via REST/WebSocket |
| `scheduler` | Celery Beat fires cron job | System-level (no user JWT) | MS Teams channel + Outlook email |
| `webhook` | External event hits `/webhooks/*` | HMAC signature | MS Teams channel + push notification |

For scheduled and webhook tasks, agents deliver results via MS Teams (`teams_post_message`) and/or Outlook email (`outlook_send_email`) instead of returning to the mobile app.

## Agent Selection by Router

```python
AGENT_MAP = {
    "finance":    FinanceAgent,
    "hr":         HRAgent,
    "sales":      SalesAgent,
    "marketing":  MarketingAgent,
    "support":    SupportAgent,
    "management": ManagementAgent,
}

# Router logic (mobile requests):
# 1. User's department provides a strong hint
# 2. LLM classification confirms or overrides
# 3. Management users can trigger any department's agent
# 4. Cross-department requests → Management Agent

# Scheduler routing:
# Celery Beat jobs specify agent directly in beat_schedule.py
# e.g. {"agent": "finance", "message": "Generate monthly summary"}

# Webhook routing:
# Webhook events map to agents via WEBHOOK_AGENT_MAP
# e.g. "customer_signed_up"      → Sales Agent
#      "support_ticket_created"  → Support Agent
#      "employee_onboarded"      → HR Agent
#      "employee_offboarded"     → HR Agent
#      "leave_request_submitted" → HR Agent
```

## Adding a New Department Agent

1. Create `/server/agents/new_dept_agent.py` inheriting from `BaseAgent`
2. Implement `can_handle()` with department-specific keywords
3. Implement `execute()` with skill loading and tool orchestration
4. Add to `AGENT_MAP` in router
5. Define permissions in `/config/roles.yaml`
6. Create required skills in `/skills/available/`
